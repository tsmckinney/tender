# Tender
Tender is a toolkit for Love2D meant for making games.
It's still in development, so some functionality might not work.
## Requirements:
* [Love2D, of course](https://github.com/love2d/love)
* [Classic by rxi](https://github.com/rxi/classic)

## Thanks:
* To rxi for Classic
* To Monogame Mastery (a book from Apress) for helping me out a little with this engine
* To a327ex for helping out with the entity manager
* And to everyone else who helped make this project possible
