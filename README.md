# Tender
Tender is a very simple game engine made in Love2D where each thing is a building block.
WARNING: This project is currently a work in progress. Some stuff might not work as expected, so be on the lookout for new updates and releases, just in case.

## Pull Requests:
If you find a bug or want to add something new, simply make an issue first, and then I'm going to get started working on it in a separate branch nicknamed after said issue. If anyone opens a pull request, I'm going to let that person do their thing. Once I merge the changes, I'll then get rid of the branch I was originally using to work on fixing the bug or adding the feature.
